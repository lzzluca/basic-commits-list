### Basic requirements

- The only tech-stack requirement here is to use React.
- The application must be available via a public URL along with the public repository.
- You do not commit any Private Authentication Keys into the repository (send them along with the repository link in your email).

### Run the app!
Run the app by the command `yarn start` on the terminal. The app is also available at the url: ${appUrl}

### Notes

### TODO
- [ ] double check package.json: there are dependencies that can be removed?
- [ ] fill in the "Notes" section at delivery time!
- [ ] add pagination for commits fetch
- [ ] add unit test coverage
- [ ] which routes to be added? e.g.: commit details view, commits' tree?
